		<li>When I think back to how blasé I was on the day I was leaving Mauritius, it seems so strange to me. Why did I think that nine months would pass by easily? Why didn’t it occur to me that for someone who hasn’t ever lived away from her family for more than a month at a time, nine months is no short span? Why didn’t I realize that I would have to celebrate with other people all the events that I’ve always spent with my family: Eid, New Year’s, my birthday?  </li>
		<li>Somehow, I just never thought about it, and so, I wasn’t really sad on that day. Apprehensive, yes, I had never travelled alone before and I had never really noted all the procedures that we had to go through, I simply followed my parents. I also didn’t want to miss my flight in Paris: I was short on time and I’d been told that the Charles de Gaulle airport was difficult to navigate and you could be lost in it for hours. I was carrying a large sum of money, which I was to deposit it in the bank when I came here, and I was paranoid that I would lose it somehow, so I kept checking for it. I had all my belongings in those three suitcases, stuff that I had assembled carefully to bring with me here, and the last thing I wanted was my luggage to be delayed. I didn’t want to go through the hassle of going back to the airport to retrieve it, I couldn’t wait to wear all my new clothes and also, I wanted to organize my dorm room as soon as I could. I knew that I wouldn’t be able to eat the non-halal meat here, but I thought I could pull it off, I wasn’t too worried about it (boy, did I turn out to be wrong!). I regarded the chicken dish that I had on the Air Mauritius flight to Paris as the last one I would have in a very long time. </li>
		<li>So, that was all I was thinking about on that night, just my immediate concerns, and I didn’t give much thought to the future. Yes, I was excited about living on my own for the first time. There were many things that I was to do alone for the first time: bank dealings, buying a laptop, health checks; but I felt ready for it. And I was, I handled everything pretty much singlehandedly, I asked for help when I needed it, and I got stuff done. I remember writing things down in a to-do list and checking them off while adding more things: it was a lot of work and seemed never-ending but it was also very fulfilling--I felt grownup and independent. I made friends, I was having fun, and there was so much to do, I never had the time to miss my folks. And then, around six weeks later came Eid.</li>
		<li>At first, I was excited, I’d been invited by my roommate, and along with another girlfriend we were preparing for a dance that we were to do on the night before, during a party that my roommate’s mom was giving. All that was so unfamiliar, it didn’t even seem like Eid to me since back home we celebrate it so differently. I went along, relegating the details to my parents. They were happy that I found a welcoming family to spend Eid with, and I enjoyed spending time with my two close friends. </li>
		<li>And then came the next day, when I went to the Eid prayer, and I was to experience homesickness for the first time in my life: I saw a lady wearing her veil in exactly the same way that my mum does, having the same light skin tone, wearing the same shade of lipstick. A ball immediately formed in my throat, my eyes welled up. I suddenly experienced a longing that I’ve never felt before, and I’ve longed for a LOT of things: independence, short hair, some idiot boy. This was unlike anything I’ve ever felt: it was intense, and it was real. I somehow managed to get a grip on myself, nevertheless when the lady hugged me Eid Mubarak, I held on slightly longer than required, and she seemed a little surprised, especially since she didn’t know me. I guess if I wanted I could’ve told her that she reminded me of my mother, but I didn’t want her to pity me, plus I didn’t want all the aunties around to start consoling me. I would also probably burst into tears if I tried to speak. So I waited for it to pass, and when I talked to my mom that night, I was back to normal. </li>
		<li>The next time it happened, I had a full-fledged breakdown. It was maybe a few weeks after Eid. I had resumed my regular way of life without any emotional outbreak, and I was comfortably settling into my routine. I talked to my mom twice a day, filled her in on the sometimes mundane details of my life which she was somehow always interested in (I realize now that I might have gotten my unusual fixation on small details from her, or maybe that’s just how moms are, and I’m just a freak), and to my dad every other day. That day, I was talking to one of my good friends from Mauritius who’s also studying abroad, and who I rarely find time to catch up with. We were both talking about how we missed home, and in the process I ended up sending her pictures of my youngest brother, whom she hadn’t seen. This resulted in me scrolling through pictures I had taken with my family, especially with the little one, sometime earlier that year. Soon after, I had to go to a club meeting. When I came back to my dorm my parents called me, as they do around that time. It turns out something had stirred in me while scrolling through those photos earlier, since even though it wasn’t on my mind, I burst into tears while talking to my mom. I terribly missed my family, especially my little brother, and I felt like I’d been holding in a waterfall of emotions, all of which were coming out through my incessant tears. It became messy, and my parents were distraught too. My roommate walked in on me bawling my eyes out and she didn’t know how to react, and now I wished I’d had my emotional breakdown somewhere in private. The more my roommate tried to console me (she was good), the worse I felt for upsetting so many people, over something none of us had any control over. </li>
		<li>Later my aunt called me, and tried to reason with me by asking me to enjoy the freedom that I had instead, but the thing is, at that moment the only thing I wanted to do was hug my little brother tight, that’s all. How do you reason with that? </li>
		<li>Finally I pulled myself together, came out of my pity party and life went back to normal. But just because I don’t cry or voice my feelings doesn’t mean that I don’t miss my family. It’s just more subtle, unconscious, not the same way you would miss a friend who’s moved away, for example. Because you miss the friend acutely for the first few days at school, but eventually you find new friends and while your old friend still matters to you, you cease to miss them. </li>
		<li>But you never replace your family, and you never lose touch completely with them either, so it’s different. You miss your family when you get a great score on that test you lost a lot of sleep on, or that job you applied for, but you can’t call them right away to share this good news because of the time difference. You miss your family when you see a friend’s parents doing the stuff for them that your parents used to do for you, but which you now have to do on your own, such as grocery shopping or laundry. You miss them when you go out and see parents laughing with their teenage kids and you see your own family in them. You miss them when you’re studying for your finals, when they used to make sure you’re eating properly and encourage you when you became exhausted or demotivated. </li>
		<li>The thing is, you miss them all the time- you just get used to the feeling. We international kids may seem like we’re no different from local students on the outside. Most of us don’t appear particularly unhappy or lonely- we seem pretty well-adjusted. Nevertheless, there’s something perpetually missing in our lives, we may not always be conscious or vocal about it, but ‘home’ is two different places for us, and we never fully let go of either of them. </li>
